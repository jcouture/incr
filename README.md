## What does `incr` do?

The process is detailed as follow:

*  Find the relevant file(s) (e.g.: `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, `mix.exs` or `version.rb`).
* Determine the existing version number.
* Increment the specified segment. If you increment the minor segment, the patch segment is set to 0 and the same goes for the major segment, the minor and patch segments are set to 0.
* Write the newly incremented version number in the relevant file(s).
* Create a new `git commit` with the relevant file with the version number as the default message (e.g.: 0.2.1).
* Create a new `git tag` pointing to the new `git commit` with the version number prefixed by a 'v' as the name (e.g.: v0.2.1).
* ðŸ’¥

```

### incr

```shell
~> gem install incr
```

## Usage
